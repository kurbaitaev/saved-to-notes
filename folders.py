"""The folder taxonomy — one definition, used everywhere.

Every note gets exactly ONE folder, so it has a single home on disk and a
single value in Notion. Cross-cutting facts (that something is a book
recommendation, a quote, a tool) stay in `tags` and `content_type`, which are
free to overlap.

Kept in its own module because the rules are consumed in three places that
must agree: the prompt sent to the model, the JSON schema that constrains its
answer, and the validator that catches anything invalid.

## Folder (exactly one — this is where the note is filed)

Pick the ONE folder matching what the viewer would USE this for:

- **{CONTENT_IDEAS}** — {DESCRIPTIONS[CONTENT_IDEAS]}
- **{MINDSET}** — {DESCRIPTIONS[MINDSET]}
- **{STARTUP}** — {DESCRIPTIONS[STARTUP]}
- **{TOOLS_AI}** — {DESCRIPTIONS[TOOLS_AI]}
- **{LEARNING}** — {DESCRIPTIONS[LEARNING]}

Tie-breaks, in order:

1. **Purpose beats subject.** "10 things founders should post" is about posting →
   {CONTENT_IDEAS}, not {STARTUP}. "How to pitch investors" is about the business →
   {STARTUP}.
2. **Tool vs outcome.** If the point is *which tool and how to drive it* → {TOOLS_AI}.
   If the tool is just the means to an outcome ("build a PR pipeline with AI") →
   file by the outcome ({CONTENT_IDEAS} here).
3. **Recommendations are NOT a folder.** A book, podcast or channel is filed by its
   SUBJECT — a book about discipline → {MINDSET}; a podcast about fundraising →
   {STARTUP}. Record that it's a recommendation in `content_type` and `tags`.
4. **Quotes** go to {MINDSET} unless the quote is squarely about one of the other
   folders (a quote about fundraising → {STARTUP}).
5. **Inspiration vs instruction.** Something that makes you *feel* like acting →
   {MINDSET}. Something that tells you *how* → the matching practical folder.
6. If two still fit, choose the one you'd look in first to act on it. Never invent
   a folder name and never leave it blank — worst case use **{LEARNING}**.
